# Graph Traversal using BFS and DFS

## Overview
This program demonstrates **Breadth First Search (BFS)** and **Depth First Search (DFS)** on a graph using an **adjacency matrix** representation.

- BFS is implemented using a **queue**
- DFS is implemented using **recursion**

---

## Graph Representation
The graph is stored as an **adjacency matrix**.

```c
int adjMatrix[MAX][MAX];
